# credit-risk-classification

For this challenge I completed the following tasks:

1. Read in the data and created a dataframe
2. Split the original dataframe into a predictor variables dataframe and outcome array
3. Split the data into training and testing datasets
4. Brought in the module and instantiated the logistic regression model from sklearn
5. Trained the model
6. Made predictions
7. Evaluated the model accuracy using a confusion matrix and classification report
8. Wrote a brief credit risk analysis report that included recommendations for use of the model

The code used in this analysis was my own and developed through my learning in the UMN Data Science Bootcamp.
